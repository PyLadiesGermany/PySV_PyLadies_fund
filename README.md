## What is the PyLadies Python Software Verband fund?

The PyLadies Python Software Verband fund is a fund that has been set up by the Python Software Verband to support PyLadies chapters in Germany. The fund is managed by a group of representatives from different chapters.

## How does it work?

### Who can request funds?

Only existing chapters or new chapters who have held at least one event and are known to the PyLadies Germany group may submit requests.

### What can funds be used for?

The fund can be used for almost anything that will help the chapter grow and support the community. This includes but is not limited to:

- Food and drinks for events
- Venue hire
- Travel costs for speakers
- Swag
- Marketing materials
- Shared subscriptions (i.e. Restream/ Lastpass)

There are some things that the fund cannot be used for. Please see the [guidelines](./guideline.md) for more information.

### How much can be requested?

There is no limit to the amount that can be requested, however, the fund is limited and shared across all chapters in Germany therefore please bear this in mind.

### How do I request funds?

To request funds you need to open an issue in this repository. There are three templates that can be used:

- [Approval Single Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/approval_single_request.md)
- [Approval Multi Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/approval_multi_request.md)
- [No Approval Request](.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/no_approval_request.md)

The templates are also available in the issue template dropdown when opening a new issue.

### How are decisions made?

The fund is managed by a group of representatives from different chapters. The representatives are listed in the [Guidelines](./guideline.md) file.

The representatives will review the request and either approve or reject it. If the request is rejected the reason will be given in the issue. If the request is approved the issue will be labelled as `approved` and the person who opened the issue will be notified.

### How do I get reimbursed?

Once the request has been approved you can go ahead and make the purchase. Once the purchase has been made you can submit the receipt for reimbursement. Reimbursement can be expected in (5-7 days).

To submit the receipt you need to email it to [invoice@python-verband.org](mailto:invoice@python-verband.org) with pyladies@python-verband.org in CC.

### How do I report on the funds?

Either once the purchase has been made, or before if you have the details, you should add the details to the issue. This will be used for reporting purposes.
