## Trustee Responsibilities

Broadly speaking the trustees are responsible for the management of the fund. This includes:
- approving or denying requests
- supporting requests (in terms of answering questions, providing guidance on application process)
- keeping track of the balance of the fund
- ensuring the fund is used in line with the guidelines
- encouraging its full use each year
- promoting the fund to the PyLadies community
- reporting on the fund to the PySV & PyLadies Germany group


## Trustee Roles

### Spokesperson

The spokesperson is the main point of contact for the fund. They are responsible for:
- answering questions about the fund
- promoting the fund
- reporting on the fund
- ensuring the fund is used in line with the guidelines
- encouraging its full use each year
- promoting the fund to the PyLadies community
- reporting on the fund to the PySV & PyLadies Germany group
- mediate between the fund trustees and the PySV board

It is expected that the spokesperson is able to regular check the repository and respond to requests in a timely manner. If the spokesperson is unable to hold this commitment they should communicate it to the rest of the approval group and find a replacement.


### Approval Group members

Approval group members are responsible for:
- approving or denying requests
- supporting requests (in terms of answering questions, providing guidance on application process)
- keeping track of the balance of the fund
- ensuring the fund is used in line with the guidelines

It is expected that requests will be responded to within a two week period. This requires approval group members to commit to actively checking the repository and responding to requests in a timely manner. If a member of the approval group is unable to hold this commitment they should communicate it to the rest of the approval group and the spokesperson, finding a replacement if necessary.


## How to become a trustee

If you are interested to join the approval group, then please raise this in slack in the [#city-germany-organisers](https://pyladies.slack.com/archives/C02EP22BBTN) channel (note this is a private slack channel, if you are not already there reach out to an existing approval group member), currently we look for one member per chapter to have all chapters represented in the group. The current approval group will then vote on the new member. If the vote is successful, the new member will be added to the approval group.

The spokesperson role will also rotate (we expect with a yearly cadence but this is not set in stone) and will be voted on by the approval group. The current spokesperson will then hand over the role to the new spokesperson.


## Onboarding checklist

- [ ] Add the new trustee to the [guideline.md](../guideline.md) file
- [ ] Add the new trustee to the github repository and team
- [ ] Add the new trustee to the slack channel for requests ([#city-germany-pysv-fund](https://pyladies.slack.com/archives/C06B761RX6X))
- [ ] Ensure any required email access is granted


## How to step down as a trustee

If you are unable to continue in your role as a trustee, please communicate this to the rest of the approval group and the spokesperson. If you are the spokesperson, please also communicate this to the PySV board. The approval group will then vote on a replacement. If you are the spokesperson, the approval group will also vote on a new spokesperson. Once the new trustee has been voted in, the current trustee will be removed from the approval group and any relevant access will be revoked.
