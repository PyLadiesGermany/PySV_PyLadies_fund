# Pyladies Germany PySV Grant Program

The annual €5000 grant program from the PySV for PyLadies aims to support the activities and growth of PyLadies chapters in Germany. It is essential to ensure that these funds are used transparently, therefore we have devised the following guidelines. The grant will be issued to PyLadies each year after the PyCon DE conference (circa June), once assigned the funds are available for disposal by the PyLadies using the following guidelines. Money not used within the year will stay on the PyLadies account and can continue to be used.

**Allowable expenses: *(this is a non exhaustive list and may be extended in the future to be more explicit)* **
- Community events: this includes room rentals, refreshments, devices used for events (for example microphone, camera, lightning), and similar costs.
- Promotional materials: such as stickers, banners, T-shirts, and other marketing materials.
- Software tools: Subscription-based tools or one-time software purchases that benefit the chapter (these may also be shared across chapters - see [shared tools list](./Docs/shared_tools.md)).
- To pay/reimburse costs to speakers for PyLadies events
- Travel reimbursement for members to go to other events (note the regional restrictions)
- Educational material for events or raffle prizes such as books, ebooks or vouchers for online courses
- Paying for design or branding work for a chapter

**Disallowed Expenditures:**
- Regional Restrictions: Funds can only be spent on activities in the DE, CH, and AT regions as defined in the [PySV Bylaws](https://python-verband.org/documents/).
- Personal expenses or any activity not related to PyLadies.
- It should be avoided that the opportunities funded benefit repeatedly only a single individual or small group of the chapter members within a single year

## Accessing funds

Chapters wishing to apply for funds should:
- Open an issue in this repo, choosing the relevant ISSUE type and follow the outlined issue template, this will include a brief statement of the intended use of the funds, detailing the purpose and amount requested. You will also be prompted to add labels relevant to your request
- If necessary wait for approval (see process below)
- Submit an invoice directly to the PySV (invoice@python-verband.org) with the PyLadies PySV email (pyladies@python-verband.org) copied in - see our [emails template](./Docs/email_templates.md) for what to include.
  - Ensure that all expenditures are accompanied by a full receipt (that lists the items paid for). 
  - For major expenditures that include sales tax, the PySV's address (see appendix) must be on the receipt.   
  - If you are paying a speaker or service provider, an invoice is preferred. However, a signed paper receipt is also acceptable.
- Reimbursement/ invoice payments will happen within 14 days
- Move the ticket to reimbursed on our project board adding any additional context regarding the funding we can share in our report (i.e. number of attendees to an event/ one or two outcomes the funding helped you achieve)

At any time you can check the process of requests on our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/PyLadiesGermany/projects/2).

## Approval Process

We want the approval process to be as quick as possible to reduce the load for individual organizers, at the same time we want to ensure that the funds are distributed in a way that maximizes our mission across Germany.

Approvals will be given by the approval group following the approval guidelines (see below). Requests will fall into one of the following approval categories:

### No approval required

For some things we want to ensure chapters can get the quickest access possible, this means the requirement for pre-approval is removed for eligible requests. The chapter must still create a ticket on our platform with relevant information but can immediately send an invoice to the PySV (with the PyLadies PySV email copied in) These items include:
- Up to 200 EUR for stickers per chapter per year
- A roll-up banner (one-time purchase) for a chapter
- Shared subscriptions i.e. streaming software or password managers (these subscriptions should have been agreed upon by the chapters beforehand, you can find a list of shared subscriptions [here](Docs/shared_tools.md))

These quick approvals apply to all existing who have had at least one official event under the PyLadies brand or are attending PyCon DE as a group. Stickers for chapters might be ordered together (to reduce costs) and this should be organised between the chapters in slack.

You can open a ticket on the project board using the issue type [instant approval](https://github.com/PyLadiesGermany/PySV_PyLadies_fund/issues/new?assignees=sleepypioneer%2Claysauchoa%2Cdiscombobulateme%2Cpga99%2Cterezaif&labels=approval_request%2Cinstant_approval&projects=&template=no-approval-request.md&title=Instant+Approval+Request). Then send the invoice to the PySV with the PyLadies PySV email (pyladies@python-verband.org) copied in - see our [emails template](./Docs/email_templates.md) for what to include.

### Single requests requiring approval

For most requests approval will be required. At least one member of the approval group who is not part of the requesting chapter should approve a request. If a member of the approval group is not sure about a request they may request that a second approval is required (but the maximum number of approvals required should be 2).

You can open a ticket on the project board using the issue type [Approval single request](https://github.com/PyLadiesGermany/PySV_PyLadies_fund/issues/new?assignees=sleepypioneer%2Claysauchoa%2Cdiscombobulateme%2Cpga99%2Cterezaif&labels=approval_request%2Capproval_single_request&projects=&template=approval-single-request.md&title=Approval+Single+Request).

Members of the approval group may ask questions regarding the funding (or point groups to existing resources that are shared by the chapters). Approvals should happen in a timely manner (see approval group description below). If a PyLady requesting funds feels the process (considering everyone involved is a volunteer) is taking too long they should raise this with the PyLadies Germany Spokesperson.

At any time you can check the process of your request on our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/PyLadiesGermany/projects/2).

We expect chapters with multiple groups within it to have transparency with one another and to help us achieve an equitable way of distributing funds.

### Request for larger amounts

Some chapters might prefer to request approval for a larger amount in one go and manage the details of how it is spent internally (specifics still need to be reported and individual invoices sent). This could be for example be requesting a proportion of the total grant for the year upfront or for a single initiative which will include multiple costs. Ideally, such initiatives may be special programs that are indicated as planned by the chapter or chapters and presented, whenever possible, at the beginning of the year in order to plan the annual budget. After approval, the chapter will be able to get reimbursements for up to this amount without the need for further approval.

These chapters should already be established, with a track record of events they have run (at least 5 events in the past 12 months) and (some) consistency in the organizing team (i.e. it should not be a whole new group who have recently taken over a chapter). It would be expected that this group would not receive approval for applications for further funds that year unless we have leftover budget (towards year end).

The amount considered would be the total grant amount divided by the current number of active chapters + an additional slice for Germany as a whole. (i.e., if there are 4 active chapters and the grant is 5000 EUR a single chapter could request 1000EUR)

**Process (differs slightly from above):**
- Open a [Approval Multi Request](https://github.com/PyLadiesGermany/PySV_PyLadies_fund/issues/new?assignees=sleepypioneer%2Claysauchoa%2Cdiscombobulateme%2Cpga99%2Cterezaif&labels=approval_request%2Capproval_multi_request&projects=&template=approval-multi-request.md&title=Approval+Multi+Request) issue in this repository for the total amount, including ideas of what it will cover (exact items should be listed afterward)
- Wait for approval for the total amount by at least 2 representatives outside of the requesting chapter
- Individual invoices should be sent to the PySV with the PyLadies PySV email (pyladies@python-verband.org) copied in - see our [emails template](./Docs/email_templates.md) for what to include.
- Reimbursement will happen within 14 days
- Individual spends should be added to the issue on the [reporting board](https://github.com/orgs/PyLadiesGermany/projects/2/views/1) marked as reimbursed with an update to the amount left
- Add any additional information we can use for reporting after the funds are spent (optional but helps with reporting)
- When the total amount has been reimbursed move the issue to the reimbursed column on the project [board](https://github.com/orgs/PyLadiesGermany/projects/2/views/1). (consideration for further funds can then happen)

### Approval Guidelines

- Sufficient funds are available
- This should include a buffer left in the 500EUR per known active chapter that has not yet drawn any funds plus 500EUR for PyLadies Germany
- The request furthers the PyLadies mission within the allowed regions and does not otherwise fall into the disallowed expenditures (ask questions if unsure)
- The requester is known to be involved in PyLadies Germany (i.e., they are listed as an organizer on Meetup.com for a PyLadies chapter, active in Slack, or known by at least one approval group member) *If the person is unknown (for example, a new chapter lead) a quick check may be required to ensure the member is actively involved in organizing for PyLadies.

**Other potential considerations:**
- Has the chapter recently requested funds, if so, consider how much and the comparison to other chapters. Active chapters are likely to request more frequently, but the budget should remain for all chapters (see point one)
- Will the request benefit multiple PyLadies. Some requests might support a single individual directly but consider if it can indirectly benefit more. i.e. Reimbursing a speaker's cost to share their knowledge with multiple PyLadies or reimbursing travel costs for a single member to attend a conference they otherwise would not be able to attend could be followed up by a blog post or presentation to share the experience with other PyLadies.

## Declined Requests

For the most part, we expect to be able to approve requests but there may be times when requests need to be declined. This may be because they do not fulfill the PyLadies mission or otherwise fall into the list of disallowed reimbursements. A reason must always be given for declined requests.

If a request is declined, it can always be remade as long as it considers the reason for declining the original request. For example, if a single chapter has made multiple requests in a year, a follow-up request might be declined to allow for other chapters to access funds. If in the last quarter of the year, there are remaining funds, the chapter with the declined request may make the request again.

We, as a group, acknowledge that this will be hard to balance and that we will have to proactively ensure bias does not play a role in decision-making. It is not unforeseeable that the process will need to be improved over time. If a PyLady feels their request has been unfairly declined, they should contact the spokesperson whose responsibility it is to raise such concerns neutrally in assembly with the rest of the approval group. All interactions regarding funding requests must follow our Code of Conduct.

## Approval Group

This group will be responsible for giving approvals on requests for funds. The group should represent as much as possible the different chapters (at least those currently active). Members will have access to add approvals to tickets submitted and also be able to ask any relevant questions for assessment.

We aim for approvals to happen promptly, we have therefore set up processes to ensure that the group is alerted to new requests as soon as possible (with the consideration that we are all volunteers). For most requests we expect to give a response within a week, for larger requests, we expect to give a response within two weeks. If for any reason we are unable to meet these deadlines, we will inform the requester and give an estimate of when we will be able to give a response.

You can also check the process of your request at any time on our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/PyLadiesGermany/projects/2).

If a member of the approval group is repeatedly unable to fulfill this, they should look for a new representative from their chapter to fill the role. We aim to have at least 3 members of this group in addition to the spokesperson.

The Approval Group has the task not only of approving or denying requests but also of keeping track of the balance of the fund and encouraging its full use each year. We know that some chapters are more active or are simply located in larger cities and have more members, so they may need to apply for a larger portion of the fund. However, it is important to keep in mind that this funding can be the incentive needed to support smaller groups to be more active or to provide the tools and means needed for their members to be more active. Similarly, this concept should prevail when it comes to using funds to encourage support for marginalized groups within PyLadies, so that it reaches those that need more support or structure.

## PyLadies Germany Spokesperson

PyLadies Germany will have a spokesperson at the PySV to mediate between the two groups and inform other chapters (existing and new) about the process. This person is responsible for supporting chapters to follow these guidelines and tracked expenses are reported. They are not responsible to singularly deliver these results as this is a shared responsibility of all chapters. If they feel that the process is being misused or have any other concerns, they should raise it with the rest of the approval group for discussion and the PySV.

The role should rotate and is open to any PyLady in Germany. A mechanism for this rotation and the period of tenure is not yet defined. 

As this person will be from one of the chapters represented in the approval group, they should refrain from being the second approver if the other representative of their chapter has already approved.
PyLadies Germany Spokesperson attendance of PySV meetings:

The spokesperson's involvement will also include attending PySV meetings. The frequency and schedule of these meetings will be determined jointly by PyLadies and PySV.

## Reporting:

The platform for approving and tracking requests should be as publicly open as possible so that any PyLady in Germany has access. Therefore no individual's personal information should be shared unless it is relevant (individuals can be referred to by their role i.e. event speaker). Invoices should not be posted there.

Tickets will be labeled by chapter and year and the platform should allow PyLadies to see at a glance what has been requested, approved, and reimbursed. Anyone should be able to make a request and there should be guidelines on how to do so.

A general update on notable events and activities should be sent to PySV every six months. This helps PySV understand the needs and accomplishments of PyLadies. The report should be sent by the spokesperson with the support of the other approval group members.

Details of all expenditures must be reported so that accounts can be properly reconciled. These are sent directly to the PySV with the [pyladies@python-verband.org](mailto:pyladies@python-verband.org) email in CC by the fund spokesperson in regular intervals (TBD: which interval, likely 6 months or yearly).
